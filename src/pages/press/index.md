## V4 migration guide

Despite the fact that PostGraphile v4 has rewritten the entire GraphQL schema generation from scratch it is still broadly compatible with version 3. There is a short list of breaking changes and the way one-to-one backward relations are handled has changed so please [read the migration guide](/postgraphile/v3-migration/) if you are updating from version 3.
