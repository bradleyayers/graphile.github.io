### About Postgraphile 

Postgraphile is the fastest way to get a full client-facing GraphQL API up and running from a PostgreSQL database schema. Backend developers can focus solely on specifying the data schema, business logic and permissions using trusted and familiar PostgreSQL - PostGraphile handles making that available as a high-performance, low-latency GraphQL API.
