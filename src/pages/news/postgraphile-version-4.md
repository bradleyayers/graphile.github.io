## Postgraphile Launches Verson 4
__A more performant, extensible and customisable GraphQL layer for PostgreSQL__

Benjie Gillam is pleased to announce the release of Postgraphile version 4. This release takes Postgraphile up to be the forerunner in GraphQL API layers. It is more performant, exetensible and customisable than ever before. 

Postgraphile v4 is 

 * Performant - just look at this amazing graph showing where Postgraphile really shines. Maybe here’s some numbers. Like 1000000 requests in just nanoseconds.

 * Highly customisable - with the new smart comments system, the user can rename or omit columns entirely from the database schema without touching the database itself. 

 * Highly extensible - the new plugin system enables users to add extra functionality to Postgraphile, enabling them to have powerful control over their API system.

This release of Postgraphile couldn’t have been possible without the community. Benjie says, “Support from the Open Source community has been invaluable. There’s been many issues and pull requests which has helped to shape Postgraphile to what it is today. And, of course, donations to my Patreon really help increase the number of hours I can put into this”


### About Postgraphile 

Postgraphile is the fastest way to get a full client-facing GraphQL API up and running from a PostgreSQL database schema. Backend developers can focus solely on specifying the data schema, business logic and permissions using trusted and familiar PostgreSQL - PostGraphile handles making that available as a high-performance, low-latency GraphQL API.
